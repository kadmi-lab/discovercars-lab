# discovercars-lab
# main.py info

This code is a Python program that creates a web application using Flask framework.

Program uses different modules, such as "os" for accessing the operating system, "json" for working with JSON data, "logging" for logging events in the application, and "flask_restful" for creating RESTful APIs.

The code sets up a Flask application and defines multiple routes that will be accessible via HTTP requests. The routes are "/api/environment", "/api/headers", and "/api/post".

Program also sets up two functions to handle requests for specific content types: "output_xml" for XML content and "output_json" for JSON content. (?)

When a user makes a request to the server, the "before_request" decorator logs information about the request, such as the request method, URL, headers, and data.

"/" route returns the text "Hello, World!".

"/api/environment" route returns a list of environment variables available in the operating system.

"/api/headers" route returns a list of HTTP headers.

"/api/post" route returns HTML code indicating that the application is working and the developer can now get some coffee.

docker-compose.yaml info 

1. File starts with a version number and then defines three services: "web", "proxy", and "db".

2. "web" service builds a Docker image from the current directory , maps the host port 3000 to the container port 3000, sets environment variables for database connectivity, mounts volumes for data storage, and declares a dependency on the "db" service.

3. "proxy" service uses an existing Docker image for the Nginx web server, mounts a configuration file and a password file, maps the host port 8080 to the container port 80, and declares a dependency on the "web" service.

4. "db" service uses an existing Docker image for the MariaDB database server, sets environment variables for database credentials and volume mapping for data storage.

5. Defines a network named "my-network" for all the services to communicate with each other.

6. This file helps in deploying the entire application stack.
